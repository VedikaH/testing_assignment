# Testing Instructions Generator

This project is a web-based application built using Streamlit that generates testing instructions for mobile app features based on screenshots. It leverages a combination of image processing and language models to generate test cases, refining them using the Gemma-2-2b model to ensure a structured format and remove redundancies.

## Features

- **Upload Multiple Screenshots**: Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats for describing testing instructions for each feature found in the image.
- **Dynamic Image Preprocessing**: Handles images with varying aspect ratios and resolutions.
- **Test Instruction Generation**: Uses the InternVL2-2B model for image understanding and Gemma-2-2b for text refinement.
- **Structured Output**: Instructions are presented in a predefined format, including descriptions, preconditions, testing steps, and expected results.
- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading and viewing results.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- Huggingface Transformers library
- PIL (Pillow)
- Torchvision

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

    ```bash
    git clone <repo-link>
    cd <repo-directory>
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. Access the app on your local browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## Usage

1. **Upload Images**: Upload one or more screenshots of your mobile app features via the file uploader.
2. **Generate Instructions**: Click on the "Describe Testing Instructions" button. The app will generate testing instructions for each image and refine them using Gemma-2-2b.
3. **View Refined Output**: The refined test instructions are displayed in the following structured format:
    - **Feature**: [Feature Name]
    - **Description**: Brief description of the feature.
    - **Pre-conditions**: Any necessary conditions before testing.
    - **Testing Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for testing.
    - **Expected Result**: The outcome expected from testing.

## Prompting Strategy

The system uses a structured prompt to ensure uniform output. The following format is used for test case generation:

- **Description**: Brief description of the feature being tested.
- **Pre-conditions**: List the necessary setup before testing.
- **Testing Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for testing the core functionality.
- **Expected Result**: Description of the expected outcome.

Users can also provide optional context to guide the instruction generation process.

## Models Used

### 1. InternVL2-2B
This model is responsible for processing the images to extract features and generate initial testing instructions. It efficiently handles multimodal inputs and associates visual elements with text descriptions.

- **Input**: Preprocessed images
- **Output**: Initial testing instructions

### 2. Gemma-2-2b
Gemma-2-2b is a causal language model used to refine the test instructions. It restructures the output for clarity, removes redundancies, and ensures the instructions follow the predefined format.

- **Input**: Text instructions generated by InternVL2-2B
- **Output**: Refined and formatted test instructions
